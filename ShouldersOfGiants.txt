â€œIf I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants" -- Sir Isaac Newton, 1675

Dart has "seen further" due to the following giants, among others:

Alan Turing for computing theory;
Tony Hoare for Algol, and the notion of null values (recanted);
Dennis Ritchie for C;
Xerox PARC for SmallTalk, the first widely-used OOP language
  (also invented the Internet, the laptop, the iPad, much more...);
Bjarne Stroustrup for C++;
Guido von Rossum for Python;
James Gosling for Java (some syntax, and the standard library, closely "resemble" Java);
Brendan Eich for JavaScript (which has very little relation to Java except the name;
  see https://darwinsys.com/blog/2022-11-java-vs-javascript/).
AND last but by no means least:
  All the developers at Google and elsewhere who've contributed to the language tooling
  and/or contributed packages to pub.dev!
