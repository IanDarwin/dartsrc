â€œIf I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants" -- Sir Isaac Newton, 1675

Dart has "seen further" due to the following giants, among others:

Alan Turing for computing theory;
Tony Hoare for Algol, and the notion of null values (recanted);
Dennis Ritchie for C;
Xerox PARC for SmallTalk, the first widely-used OOP language;
Bjarne Stroustrup for C++;
Guido von Rossum for Python;
James Gosling for Java (the standard library closely resembles Java);
Brendan Eich for JavaScript (which has almost no relation to Java except the name;
see https://darwinsys.com/blog/2022-11-java-vs-javascript/).
